# ConstraintSatisfactionProblems
Solves a CSP like the Map coloring problem or Sudoku by using backtracking, backtracking with forward checking, backtracking with AC-3 with and without degree heuristics, least constraining-value, and minimum-remaining-value. A Local search / Min-conflicts is also used to give a solution.
